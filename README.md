# DND Dice Usage

This is a command bar tool, so run it from your command line or terminal using `Python3 <filepath>`.

Current commands:
- roll <**4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20**>
- quit <**None**>
- clear <**None**>

To stack commands, use the "and" keyword:
- e.g. roll 4 and clear and roll 4 and roll 6

To run one command with multiple arguments use the "," keyword:
- e.g. roll 4,8,10
